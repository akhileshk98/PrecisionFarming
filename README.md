# PrecisionFarming

The project aims to develop an autonomous robotic system for precision farming to
enhance agricultural productivity sustainably. The robot will navigate autonomously using a camera,
identify plant conditions, and perform actions like weeding and spraying pesticides to maintain
crop health. Real-time coordination will allow multiple robots to assume roles such as observer,
weeder, and crop protector. Using Multi-agent UML (MUML) techniques and ResNet-18 for image
processing, the system ensures precise interventions. UPPAAL for mechatronics modeling guarantees
performance and reliability. This innovation reduces manual labor, minimizes chemical use, and
supports sustainable farming practices.
